This repository contains examples of C programs I wrote while studying a computer science course. 
They include tasks involving loops, conditionals, arrays, algorithms, pointers, and data structures such as typedef. 
These tasks helped me practice basic programming concepts and problem-solving.

## Topics I learned and practiced
- variables and data types
- loops (for, while)
- conditionals (if / else)
- functions
- arrays and strings
- algorithms (searching, sorting logic, recursion)
- command-line arguments
- working with memory blocks
- debugging and testing

## About the tasks
Each file has a short description explaining what the program does.
